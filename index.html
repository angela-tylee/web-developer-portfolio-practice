                <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
                <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a
                    skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
                <p>I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young
                    minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>

                You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and
                become a leader in something you're passionate about.</p>
